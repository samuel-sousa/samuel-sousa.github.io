**Abstract**: Homicide mortality is a worldwide concern and has occupied the agenda of researchers and public managers. 
In Brazil, homicide is the third leading cause of death in the general population and the first in the 15-39 age group. 
In South America, Brazil has the third highest homicide mortality, behind Venezuela and Colombia. 
To measure the impacts of violence it is important to assess health systems and criminal justice, as well as other areas. 
In this paper, we analyze the spatial distribution of homicide mortality in the state of Goiás, Center-West of Brazil, since the homicide rate increased from 24.5 per 100,000 in 2002 to 42.6 per 100,000 in 2014 in this location. 
Moreover, this state had the fifth position of homicides in Brazil in 2014. We considered socio-demographic variables for the state, performed analysis about correlation and employed three clustering algorithms: K-means, Density-based and Hierarchical. 
The results indicate the homicide rates are higher in cities neighbors of large urban centers, although these cities have the best socioeconomic indicators.
